### Purpose and Background
[Cover_Page.PNG](resources/Cover_Page.PNG)
Louise, a very good friend and a brilliant writer, recently attempted to raise funds to produce a play she wrote (> Fever!!).  Her attempt was, however, unsuccessful. Knowing the person she is and the mottos she aspires to (> Try, Try Again < and > Never Give Up <), she wanted to gain a more thorough perspective in how to approach another attempt with a successful outcome. She was able to obtain a dataset of other Kickstarter projects from around the world for a variety of fundable projects. In some previous analysis attempts I conducted for her, she has seen a more directed approach to center this analysis attempt. There are two decision points that she believes will provide guidelines on how to better organize her fundraising activities. They are: (a) how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and (b) compare whether they attained their funding goals.
