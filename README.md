# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing the analysis on Louise-s dataset for Kickstarter projects (goals vs pledged) trend data

From Bootcamp module: In addition to your findings, you should also include charts and graphs (visualizations) in your report. Visualizations help communicate the story the data is telling by making it more understandable and coherent. At the end of the report, add any recommendations you have for Louise based on your findings. Then add a descriptive commit message and click "Commit changes." This descriptive README file adds depth to the repository as well as your analysis. It's ready to be shared!

Return to the main page of your GitHub repository, highlight the address, and copy it. This link, which should read https://github.com/yourusername/kickstarter-analysis, (Links to an external site.) can now be emailed to our hopeful playwright, Louise, so she can begin her Kickstarter preparations.
