### Purpose and Background
Louise, a very good friend and a brilliant writer, recently attempted to raise funds to produce a play she wrote (*"Fever!!"*).  Her attempt was, however, unsuccessful. Knowing the person she is and the mottos she aspires to (*Try, Try Again* and *Never Give Up*), she wanted to gain a more thorough perspective in how to approach another attempt with a successful outcome. She was able to obtain a dataset of other Kickstarter projects from around the world for a variety of fundable projects. In some previous analysis attempts I conducted for her, she has seen a more directed approach to center this analysis attempt. There are two decision points that she believes will provide guidelines on how to better organize her fundraising activities. They are: (a) how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and (b) compare whether they attained their funding goals. 

Using the Kickstarter dataset that Louise provided, we will be able to see whether the fundraising category outcomes are related to their launch dates. Also, she may be able to see a relationship between the funding outcome and the amount of the funding goals. The outcomes are below:

•	Successful (met or exceeded funding goal), 

•	Live (project has not completed yet), 

•	Failed (did not meet the funding goal),  and

•	Canceled (due to reasons unforeseen, the fundraising attempt was halted).

Ultimately, Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their kickstart funding launch dates and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

***Overview of Analyses***
Looking at the data Louise obtained, there were many opportunities to observe the above factors and their impact on the success (or not) of the pertinent Kickstarter. There are logically two characteristics of the Kickstarter Programs that had to be addressed so the data could be trusted. One thing to focus on is the fact this data was obtained all over the world. After an initial look at the data, the overall ratios of successful campaigns were basically the same, no matter the country. By example, here are two graphs showing the US and Great Britain’s data for the success rates on the Parent Categories of Kickstarters.

We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category was the most successful (see above chart).


In comparison against the US data, visually it appears the US had a similar successful campaign for the master Parent Category of >THEATER.hat

Another factor that could impact the success rate of the project was how the kickstarters were conducting from country to country. This was controlled by analyzing the date that the kickstarters were launched.

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May as seen in this chart. However, January, June, July and  October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.
